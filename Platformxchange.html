                                11.1 These Terms constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Bizagi and govern
                                your use of the Connectors Xchange and Products, and completely replace any prior

                                11.2 You agree that if Bizagi does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
                                is contained in these Terms (or which Bizagi has the benefit of under any applicable law),
                                this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Bizagi’s rights and that those rights or
                                remedies will still be available to Bizagi.
                            </p>

                                11.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
                                provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms
                                without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of these Terms will
                                continue to be valid and enforceable.

                                Bizagi without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor Bizagi shall
                                be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under these Terms without
                                the prior written approval of the other party.

                                the laws of England without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Bizagi agree
                                to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England to resolve any legal
                                matter arising from these Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Bizagi shall still be
                                allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in

                                J. <strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BIZAGI, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS
                                LICENSORS ARE NOT LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
                                INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU THROUGH
                                YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCT, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA OR DAMAGE TO YOUR SYSTEM, HARDWARE, OR
                                OTHER DEVICE, WHETHER OR NOT BIZAGI OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD
                                HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                K. <strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1. These Terms and Conditions and any other terms incorporated by reference constitute the
                                entire Agreement between you and Bizagi relating to the Product and govern your use of the
                                Product, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and
                                Bizagi regarding the Product.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. Any applicable open source software license to the extent that it applies to the
                                Product, these Terms and Conditions, the Bizagi Web Site Terms of Use to the extent that it
                                applies to the Product, and any other applicable Service-specific Terms of Service shall
                                take precedence in that order in the event of a conflict between them, to the extent of
                                such conflict.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3. The failure of Bizagi to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms and
                                Conditions does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, which will still be
                                available to Bizagi.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                4. If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
                                provision of these Terms and Conditions is invalid, then that provision will be removed
                                from the Terms and Conditions without affecting the rest of the Terms and Conditions. The
                                remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions will continue to be valid and
                                enforceable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                5. The rights granted in these Terms and Conditions may not be assigned or transferred by
                                either you or Bizagi without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
                                Bizagi are permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under these Terms
                                and Conditions without the prior written approval of the other party.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                6. These Terms and Conditions and your relationship with Bizagi under these Terms and
                                Conditions will be governed by the laws of England without regard to its conflict of laws
                                provisions. You and Bizagi agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
                                England to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms and Conditions.
                                Notwithstanding this, you agree that Bizagi will still be allowed to apply for injunctive
                                remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
